## My process

In this project, I built a gallery slideshow using a masonry layout on the homepage. Despite not initially knowing what a masonry layout was, I was able to successfully implement it using basic JavaScript and CSS. While I had initially planned to use React, I encountered some difficulties with routing to each slide, so I switched gears and opted for a simpler approach. Overall, I was able to achieve the desired design and functionality for the project.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

In this project, I challenged myself to build a gallery slideshow using a masonry layout on the homepage. This was a new concept for me, so I had to research how to implement it using CSS. I initially planned to use React but ran into issues with routing to each slide, so I decided to switch to basic JavaScript instead.

Throughout the project, I gained a deeper understanding of how to create interactive components for web development using JavaScript. I also learned how to troubleshoot issues that arose during the development process, such as the routing issue that I encountered. Overall, I was able to achieve the desired design and functionality for the project, and I am excited to apply the skills and knowledge that I gained in future projects.

### Continued development

Through this project, I gained valuable experience in implementing a masonry layout, building a gallery slideshow, and troubleshooting issues that arose during the development process. Moving forward, I plan to continue expanding my skillset and knowledge base in web development, with a particular focus on mastering React and other popular front-end frameworks.

I also plan to improve my understanding of back-end development, including server-side languages and databases. Additionally, I am committed to staying up-to-date with the latest web development trends and best practices, as well as continuing to learn and grow as a developer.

Overall, I am excited to continue developing my skills and expertise in web development and to take on new challenges and projects in the future.
